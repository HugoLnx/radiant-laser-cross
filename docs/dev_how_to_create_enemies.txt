How To Create Enemies
=====================

0. Design the enemy
-------------------

0.1. Decide what makes it special.

 - what skills of the player does it challenges;
 - in which kind of context is it easy to beat;
 - in which kind of context is it hard to beat;

0.2. Decides the kind of appearance it will have.

 - Inspiration from everywhere helps.
 - Don't forget that shape inform function.

0.3. Define it's look and animations.

 - Draw it.
 - Decide which parts are body parts (parts that can be hit)
 - Decide colors (white means can be hit by all colors, grey or black means not hittable).
 - Note if you want some animations.
 - Decide if you need the graphics to be from Blender or another editor; OR if making something from basic shapes in Uniy is enough.

0.4. Define special behavior.

 - Note the kind of movement it would make.
 - Note if you want that some parts to change colors.
 - Note if some parts are linked to the life of the whole thing,
   or if they have their own life (acting like shields or like some different weapons that can be destroyed separately)
 - etc.

1. Setup A forge
----------------

If you didn't yet, create a scene by duplicating the Main scene.
That's your forge. Experiment there.
Most of us will name the scene to our own name/pseudonym.

2.A. Duplicate an ennemy and tweak it
-----------------------------------

If you want to make something similar to another enemy,
start with duplicating the prefab of that enemy.
To do that, go into Assets/Prefabs/ennemies/ and select the enemy to duplicate (Ctrl+D or Edit menu).
Then just edit the parametters and look!

2.B. Create an enemy from scratch
-------------------------------

2.1. If you want to create an ennemy from scratch, first create the global look of the enemy by creating an object:
2.2. If you want to use Unity's 3D shapes, first create an object of the shape you want for the part of the enemy that you consider to be it's core.
    Most of the time I use a cube, but any geometric shape should be ok as long as it's made of lines.
    (Cylinders can work but it's better if you can see the lines of the base circle).
    Then for each other part of the enemy that must move with it, create a sub oject with the shape you want.
2.3. If you want to use a 3D model, drag'n'drop it in the scene so that it creates an object of it.

2.4. Continue creating the whole shape of the enemy (if it's made of several parts) by adding sub objects corresponding to the different parts.
     The main parts to have separate are:
     - the parts that can be hit but have separate collision boxes;
     - the parts that needs to be animated independently (for example if it's a big enemy with several canons all targeting the moving player);

3. What makes an enemy
----------------------

To make the game react to your enemy object correctly, it have to be setup with the following behaviours:

3.1. Add ColoredBody behaviour to each sub-object (or maybe the object itself) that can be hit.
    - ColoredBody represents a body that is associated to a color familly and is used to get information when checking if the body color matches a bullet color for example;
    - ColoredBody will only collide properly if the same object also have a RigidBody. Of course usually this imply also a mesh and collider.
    - Once set, you can configure it and in particular decide what is the associated color familly (we will try to detect it automatically later from the material but for now do it manually).
    - One enemy can have several body parts that can be hit. Each one of them must have a ColoredBody.
    - ColoredBody do not hold the hit points of the enemy. See the next points.
    - Do not fill the life_control field, it will be filled automatically later. See the next points.

3.2. Add one LifeControl behavior to the enemy object. Usually to the root.
    - LifeControl handles the hit points or life points of the enemy. This is what decides how many hit this enemy can take.
    - LifeControl's
